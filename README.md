# Eyelid-tumors-YOLOv7_CNFG
This repository contains the source code for developing an object localization, combined with pure convolutional network ConvNeXt, FReLU activation function and GIoU_loss function (YOLOv7_CNFG) system for the automated classification of benign and malignant eyelid tumors. This system provides a practical strategy for automatic diagnosis of eyelid tumors.
